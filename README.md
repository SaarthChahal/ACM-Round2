------------------My Learning Journey------------------

BACKEND DEVELOPMENT

I started learning about backend by beginning the course on html at codecademy.com, the .html files which that platform taught me to create have been uploaded on this platform, as well as a practice project (Fashion blog website).

Next I began Learing Django, once again from Codecademy and utilised the knowledge I gained to create a little project which is a fortune telling website, one which prints a random positive message as your fortune.

COMPETITVE CODING

I am keenly interested in competitive coding and have solved some advanced beginner difficulty level problems on codechef (coding language is python). I wish to expand my knowledge of python and solve even trickier problems.
